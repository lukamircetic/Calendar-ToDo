# To-do List app

An app that allows you to set a to do list for specific days and toggle between them

Here is the temporary URL while i purchase a domain:
https://calendar-todo-luka.herokuapp.com/




### What's left to develop:
- [x] need to fix issue with the creation of lists with multiple users, atm it only works with myself due to mongodb indexes not being unique
- [x] need to add styles to the login page and also a description
- [x] add styles to homepage
- [x] when switching between create account and login need to blank the fields
- [x] need to host app on heroku so that you are able to access db from anywhere

Version 2 potential features:
- [ ] maybe add different coloured modes
- [ ] create a general list
- [ ] find some api's to sync with... google login, etc would be cool
- [ ] add a settings menu
