# To-do List app

An app that allows you to set a to do list for specific days and toggle between them

Please note that the login functionality is currently down, please use the app as a guest while I work to bring it back online. The to-do's you make will not save, the guest mode is just for proof of concept, Thanks.
Demo deployed at: http://calendartodo.surge.sh/




What's left to develop:
- need to fix issue with the creation of lists with multiple users, atm it only works with myself due to mongodb indexes not being unique
- need to add styles to the login page and also a description
- when switching between create account and login need to blank the fields
- maybe add different coloured modes
- need to host app on heroku so that you are able to access db from anywhere
